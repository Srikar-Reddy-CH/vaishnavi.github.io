<h1><u>TREES</u></h1>
<p>A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure <br> consisting of a collection of nodes such that each <br> node of the tree stores a value and a list of references <br> to other nodes.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another. </p>

                <strong><h2><u><em>Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?</em></u></h2></strong>
				<p>The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e, they are not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or we can say it is a hierarchical structure. For this reason, the tree is considered to be a non-linear data structure.The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e, they are not stored linearly.

				<h2><u>Properties</em></u></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Traversing in a tree is done by depth first search and breadth first search algorithm.</li>
				    <li>It has no loop and no circuit</li>
					<li>It has no self-loop</li> 
				    <li>Its hierarchical model.</li>

				<h2><strong><u><em>Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure</em></u></strong>:</h2>
				<img src="image2.png" alt="Error loading image" width="800" height="350">
				<p><strong>Parent Node</strong>: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.</p>
				<p><strong>Child Node</strong>: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node.</p>
				<p><strong>Root Node</strong>: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.</p>
				<p><strong>Leaf Node or External Node</strong>: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.</p>
				<p><strong>Ancestor of a Node</strong>: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node.</p>
				<p><strong>Desndancet</strong>: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node.</p>
				<p><strong>Level of a node</strong>: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.</p>
				<p><strong>Subtree</strong>: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.</p>
			    </ul>


				<hr color="green" width="1200">

				<h3><em><u>Properties of a Tree:</u></em></h3>
				<p><b>Number of edges</b>: An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.</p>

				<p><b>Depth of a node</b>: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.</p>

                <p><b>Height of a node</b>: The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.</p> 

				<p><b>Height of the Tree</b>: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.</p>

			     <p><b>Degree of a Node</b>: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.</p>

				<h3><u><em>Syntax:</em></u></h3>
				<h4><p>
					struct Node <br>
					{ <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int data; <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct Node *left_child; <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct Node *right_child; <br>
					};</p></h4> 

					<h3><u><em>Basic Operation Of Tree:</em></u></h3>
					<p>&#x2022 Create – Create a tree in data structure. <br>
						&#x2022 Insert − Inserts data in a tree. <br>
						&#x2022 Search − Searches specific data  in a tree to  check it is present or not. <br>
						&#x2022 Preorder Traversal – Perform Traveling a tree in a pre-order manner in data structure . <br>
						&#x2022 In order Traversal – Perform Traveling a tree in an in-order manner. <br>
						&#x2022 Post order Traversal –Perform Traveling a tree in a post-order manner.</p>


						<hr color="green" width="1200">

						<h3><em><u>Applications of Tree data structure:</u></em></h3>
						<p><b>Spanning trees</b>: It is the shortest path tree used in the routers to direct the packets to the destination. </p>
						<p><b>Binary Search Tree</b>: It is a type of tree data structure that helps in maintaining a sorted stream of data.  

							Full Binary tree
							Complete Binary tree
							Skewed Binary tree
							Strictly Binary tree
							Extended Binary tree</p>
						<p><b>Storing hierarchical data</b>: Tree data structures are used to store the hierarchical data, which means data is arranged in the form of order.  </p>
						<p><b>Syntax tree</b>: The syntax tree represents the structure of the program’s source code, which is used in compilers.  </p>
						<p><b>Trie</b>: It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking. It is also used for locating specific keys from within a set. </p>
						<p><b>Heap</b>: It is also a tree data structure that can be represented in a form of an array. It is used to implement priority queues.  </p>
